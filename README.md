This is the code of my Master degree dissertation.
The Radner file contains the basic deep-learning model code for the Radner equilibrium system of forward and backward stochastic differential equations.
The Example file includes an example of Radner equilibrium with 10 sources of randomness and only one agents in a incomplete market.
